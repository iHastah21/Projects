# Tahmid Ahmed, Uni Student doing Computer Science Degree
My name is Tahmid Ahmed doing a computer science course at UEL. My main interests with this includes cybersecurity, AI and game development.

I have experience coding in python to make a simple 2d platformer game. Through my studies, I am hoping to become a game developer or a data analyst/scientist

Outside of this, my main hobbies include gaming and going on nature walks.
